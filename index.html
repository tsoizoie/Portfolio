      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Originally from the Bay Area, California, I'm now in my second-year studying at Michigan State University for a Bachelor of Arts in Games and Interactive Media, as well as pursuing a minor in Computer Science. While my focus is game programming, I also have a great interest in game design and art.</p>
