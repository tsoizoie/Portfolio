          <p><b>Scary Pants</b><p>
          <p>Final Draft submitted May 4th, 2023</p>
          <hr>
          <p>We created a horror maze game. The goal of the game is to power the generator in order to escape Scary Pants. You have a limited field of vision from your flashlight, that recharges with each battery you collect.</p>
