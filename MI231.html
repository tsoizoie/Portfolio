          <p><b>New Rally X Remake</b><p>
          <p>Classic Game Project</p>
          <hr>
          <p>The task was to recreate a retro arcade game, we chose the 1981 game "New Rally X." The goal is to collect all the flags, including the special flag which gives you double the points for all the remaining flags, and the lucky flag which gives you points based on the amount of fuel you have left.</p>

          <p>We created a horror maze game. The goal of the game is to power the generator in order to escape Scary Pants. You have a limited field of vision from your flashlight, that recharges with each battery you collect.</p>
