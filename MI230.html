      <p>These are my projects from MI 230, the Game Design course at Michigan State University.</p>
      <p>In this course, we were tasked with creating our own non-digital games. We were free to design what we wanted, how we wanted.</p>
      <p>Course taken in Spring Semester of 2023.</p>
      <p>All uploaded to <a href = "https://zoietsoi.itch.io/">https://zoietsoi.itch.io/</a></p>
